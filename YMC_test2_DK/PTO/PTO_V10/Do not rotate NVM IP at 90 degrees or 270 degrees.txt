We always suggest customers place the IP in the same direction as how we verify the testchip to avoid inconsistency of cell performance.

Therefore, please do not rotate NVM IP at 90 degrees or 270 degrees.

Placing the NVM IP at 0 degree or rotate it by 180 degrees or horizontal /vertical mirror are allowed.
